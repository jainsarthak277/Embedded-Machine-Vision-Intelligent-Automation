# Embedded-Machine-Vision-Intelligent-Automation
Codes and documentation for all assignments and projects performed in ECEN 5863 - Embedded Machine Vision and Intelligent Automation 
under Prof. Sam Siewert.

Focuses on using OpenCV APIs on Nvidia's Jetson Nano to perform image processing operations.
Uses these operations to develop a self-driving car prototype featuring pedestrian detection, vehicle recognition, 
traffic sign recognition and lane detection. Has pseudo driving assist features indicating warnings if warning signs are seen on-road.

Uses concepts of real-time scheduling, CPU utilization, mutexes, semaphores, multithreaded applications, OpenCV, image transforms and 
cascade classification.
